<p>
  The <pre>page.html</pre> page type is the simplest type of page and is minimally processed.
</p>

<p>
  The markdown page also supports most <pre>html</pre> content, but some pages
  benefit the lack of flexibility markdown offers, and offers clarity by just building with html.
</p>

<p>
  You can nest pages inside of an html page:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="./html-sub-page/">Html sub page</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="./md-sub-page/">md sub page</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

</p>

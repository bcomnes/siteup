# Loose Markdown

Loose markdown are markdown files that are **not** named `README.md`.

A loose markdown file named `foo.md`, builds into `foo.html`, in whatever directory it lives in. They don't get a page level `client.js` file, or `style.css` file, but you can set variables in the markdown frontmatter (as seen above).
